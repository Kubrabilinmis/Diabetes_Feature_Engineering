## Business Problem 
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

## Dataset Description 
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. are data. The target variable is specified as "Outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

## Variables
- Pregnancies : Number of pregnancies
- Glucose : 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood Pressure : Blood Pressure (Smallness) (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness : Skin Thickness
- Insulin : 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function : Function (2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test)
- BMI : Body mass index
- Age : Age (years)
- Outcome : Have the disease(1) or not (0)
